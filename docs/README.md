<h1>Personal Pokedex</h1>

**This is a personal project that I am working on while attempting to learn more about various libraries in Python. Feel free to let me know what I can improve upon. I'm just starting out, so any advice is welcome.**

<h2>Concept</h2>

I want to create a GUI interface as I learn the fundamentals of several different aspects of Python, GitHub, and everything else this is going to involve.

This project is going to be a "Pokedex" style application that pulls data from the PokeAPI, organizes and displays it in a visually pleasing way. I hope to learn a bit about design and GUI construction along the way.

The data that I'm focusing on for each Pokemon is as follows: Name, types, evolutionary line, which species it evolves from, weight, height, stats (HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed), color, generation of origin, if they're legendary, their first official pokedex entry, and an image (either official artwork or sprites)

<h2>Current Status</h2>

Only the data collection script is done. It will scrape the PokeAPI for the information that I listed up above and save it to a headered ```.csv``` file for manipulation. Other than that, nothing else is working. This is very much a beginner's work in progress project. I have a full time job unrelated to development and a family to provide for, so it will likely be slow going. Still, I'm more than happy to receive any advice, criticism, and anything else.
