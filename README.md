**This is a personal project that I am working on while attempting to learn more about various libraries in Python. Feel free to let me know what I can improve upon. I'm just starting out, so any advice is welcome.**

The information that I'm looking to store for each Pokemon is as follows:

1. Name
2. Types
3. Evolutionary Line
4. Evolves From What Species?
5. Weight
6. Height
7. Stats
    a. HP
    b. Attack
    c. Defense
    d. Special Attack
    e. Special Defense
    f. Speed
8. Color
9. Generation of Origin
10. If Legendary
11. Pokedex Entry
12. Official Artwork

<h5>WIP</h5>

The data collection script is completed. It completely fills a csv file and downloads the official artwork for every pokemon that is passed to the "create_data_frame" function. I'm going to work on a way to interact with the data next.
